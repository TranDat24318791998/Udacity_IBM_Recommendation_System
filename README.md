If you can check notebook, please try with html file

## **Installations**
This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries:
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

## **Data**
The project uses the following datasets:
- **`user-item-interactions.csv`**: Contains records of user interactions with articles.
- **`articles_community.csv`**: Provides descriptions of the articles.

---

## **Summary**
The project contains the following tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicates and clean the data to prepare for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze interaction patterns and user behavior.
3. **Rank-Based Recommendations**:
   - Recommend popular articles for new users.
4. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Build a recommendation system based on user-user similarity.
5. **Matrix Factorization**:
   - Decompose the user-item interaction matrix using SVD to generate recommendations.
6. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate recommendation accuracy and address cold-start problems.
